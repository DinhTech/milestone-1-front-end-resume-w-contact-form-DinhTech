You will be evaluated on the following points. You must complete all 4 of mandatory sections to pass:

Requirements Points

Mandatory Section

Functional / General Requirements (11):

● Assignment submitted on time.

● Resume is free of spelling and grammar errors.

● Contact form will not permit any Battlestar Galactica swears: ["feldercarb", "frack", "skinjob",
"vulgacarb"]

● Resume web page has a github link.

● Repository on Github Repository has consistent commits (not just a few commits the day before it is
due).

o Commit messages describe the code changes within the commit.

● Repository has a README.md.

o README.md has a Trello link and Trello is public.

o README.md has a citations summary.

● Any “borrowed” code has in-line comment citations.

● Commented out code has been removed.
CSS and Design Requirements (13):

● No W3C CSS validator errors.

● Reset script is linked properly so as to not overwrite any custom styles.

● CSS selectors are only as specific as they need to be.

● Hex codes or rgb/rgba values are used for colours. Not named colours ('red', 'blue', 'chartreuse').

● Absolute and relative positioning are not used (top, bottom, left, right properties).

● Responsive layout for mobile devices is included, and is the base styleset (mobile first, no media query
therefore).

● Responsive layout for tablets is included.

● Responsive layout for desktop computers is included.

● Website demonstrates good use of Contrast.

● Website demonstrates good use of Alignment.

● Website demonstrates good use of Repetition.

● Website demonstrates good use of Proximity.

● CSS is properly indented.

HTML5 Requirements (15):

● No W3C HTML validator errors.

● No WCAG validator accessibility errors.

● Semantic HTML5 used wherever possible.

● Divs and spans are only used where necessary for styling purposes.

● Code does not contain inline style attributes.

● Code does not contain inline JavaScript event listeners.

● Tags and attribute names are lowercase.

● Classes and IDs are camelcase.

● Tags are closed and nested properly.

● Images have been optimized by ImageOptim (or similar tool).

● Form elements are paired with labels elements containing the for attribute.

● Alt attributes exist on all <img> elements.

● Uses a valid <title> element with a valid text node.

● Uses description metadata.

61

● HTML is properly indented.

JavaScript Requirements (22):

● No console errors while running the site AND no errors when validating JS at
https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html

● Code avoids hardcoded values where possible, using constants values instead.

● Unused or unreachable code is not present.

● No console.log()’s are present (unless you have strong justification for why you need it).

● Variables and constants are in camelcase, functions and methods are in pascalcase.

● Variables, constants, methods and functions are named semantically.

● Global variables (var) are not used, only let and const are used.

o All variables are declared before being used.

o Constants are used over variables when possible.

● Code is well-structured (one entry point, one exit point per code block), no returns (other than at the end
of a method), breaks or continues are used.

● JavaScript does not add inline CSS styles.

● When selecting elements with JavaScript, if a reference to a more direct parent exists, that is used for the
selection rather than the document node (myList.querySelector() vs document.querySelector).

● Javascript named methods contain a docstring comment describing inputs, outputs and purpose.

● Code that will run at the same point in all branches of a decision is removed from the decision.

● For and for-of/for-in loops are used over while loops where appropriate (counter-controlled, array
iteration).

● Form errors are displayed in an unordered list so the user can see multiple errors at once.

● The form will only submit if the form validates, otherwise the default submit behaviour will be prevented.

● ES6 techniques are used over ES5 techniques (for-of over array.forEach, arrow functions over anonymous
functions, etc).

● Variables and constants are scoped appropriately.

● Variables and constants are declared at the beginning of their parent code block.

● The script is deferred.

● JavaScript is properly indented.
